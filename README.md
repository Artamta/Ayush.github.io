This site is my digital home where I share research, projects, and ideas at the intersection of AI, climate science, and healthcare.

👨‍🎓 About Me

Hi, I’m Ayush Raj, a BS–MS student at IISER Pune.
I am passionate about data-driven science, with a focus on:

🌍 Climate Modeling & Forecasting (transformers, extreme events, HPC workflows)

🧬 Biomedical Imaging (quantitative MRI, cancer detection, signal modeling)

🤖 Machine Learning & AI (deep learning, graph neural networks, generative AI)

⚡ High-Performance Computing (Slurm, distributed training, scalable pipelines)

My goal: to build interpretable AI systems that solve real-world problems in sustainability and healthcare.
