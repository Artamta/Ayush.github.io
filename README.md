👨‍🎓 About Me

I’m Ayush Raj, a BS–MS student at IISER Pune, working on:

🌍 Climate modeling & forecasting with Transformers

🧬 Biomedical imaging (quantitative MRI, cancer detection)

⚡ HPC workflows with Slurm & distributed ML

🤖 Deep learning, graph neural networks, generative AI

📌 My goal is to design interpretable AI systems for sustainability and healthcare.

🔬 Research & Projects
Fuxi-Transformer for Climate Forecasting

Transformer-based framework for 15-day global weather forecasts using 70+ variables.

// Example snippet of project workflow
const runModel = (dataset) => {
  return Transformer.train(dataset, {epochs: 50, lr: 1e-4});
}
